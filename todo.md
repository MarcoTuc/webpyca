- for each base implementation, create a parameter set display that:
  - lets you control them with input-fields or sliders 
  - lets you pick them from pre-made interesting parameter sets 

- implement a `reinitialize` button that lets you re-run the code from scratch, because `Run` is used to pick up from the last state. 

- check with Vass the RGB Lenia implementation, because it looks strange. Why is there a top-left directional drift always?
